# Project-Skyfall
 This project will be an safety system when a pilot knocks out cold and the guest (or new students) come and use the plane. Normally this would be hard if youre trying to controll something that you dont know and it will be dangerous. So with this project it will say simple things like pull up (which even the day one students know.) and so on,
